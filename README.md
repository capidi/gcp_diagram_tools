Aim of the project is to share tools that I use for creating GCP based solution architecture diagrams. [SOLUTION ICONS FOR ARCHITECTURAL DIAGRAMS](https://cloud.google.com/icons/) provides : 
- a set of presentation templates
- downloadable digital assets. 
- link to LucidChart that provides native GCP support
Being more of a [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) user myself, I have created some custom libraries from the published digital assets (icons in PNG/SVG format).
